              <p>
                I am 31 years old. I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon. I
                graduated from Oregon State University with a bachelors in
                Marketing. I started my career in sales while in the pursuit of
                a marketing/advertising job. After a while of playing around on
                online coding classes I decided to make the jump into the world
                of tech! This lead me to enrolling in Epicodus to study web
                development, and here we are today. I recently completed an
                internship with Theorem Agency, and I'm entering the job market
                seeking a software development position.
